# Refinements Applied for COSEM Segmentation
The two csv files summarize refinements applied to COSEM predictions to produce the final segmentations described in the paper.  `organelle_refinements` contains refinements for the organelles themselves, whereas `contact_refinements` describes the refinements applied for contact site analysis. These refinements are also provided in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRS_XGk53f-ts_7I7cVfw36utx2fgIwnUj0Aa0ubhtQ/edit#gid=1047045284), which also contains a summary of some of the analysis results.
